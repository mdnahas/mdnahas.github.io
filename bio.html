<h2> Where I've lived and worked </h2>

<p>  I was born in Indiana, but moved to Pennsylvania at age 3.  I lived in
Reading, PA until I was 10 and then moved to Allentown, PA.  At 17, I
moved to Austin, TX, where I finished high school. </p> 

<p>  I did my undergraduate in Computer Science at Notre Dame from 1991 to
1995.  During that time, I worked summers in Austin at Motorola and
spent the Spring of 1994 in London, UK.  I did my graduate work in
Computer Science at the University of Virginia from 1995 to 2001.  I
taught one summer for The Center for Talented Youth at the Franklin
and Marshall Campus in Lancaster, PA. </p> 

<p>  I spent 2001 to 2002 in Austin.  From 2002 to 2004, I lived in Eden
Prairie, MN and worked at Architecture Technology Corp..  From there,
I moved to NYC and worked for Broadway Technology LLC from 2004 to
2007. Some of that time was spent at Cantor Fitzgerald as a
consultant.  I spent the spring and summer of 2007 in Berkely, CA
sailing on San Francisco Bay.  From 2007 to 2010, I was back in NYC
working for Walleye Trading LLC.  In 2011, I went to work for Tower
Research LLC and then in 2012 for OkCupid.com. </p> 

<p>  In 2012 and 2013, I researched writing mathematical proofs on a
computer.  I started working in NYC, but then became a Visitor at the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ.  In the summer of 2013,
I spent 90 days in Nijmegen, the Netherlands while working with
researchers at Radboud University Nijmegen. </p> 

<p>  In late 2013, I moved to Austin, TX to help my brother who had
fractured his femur.  In 2014, I was working at the Capital Factory
and sitting in on classes at UT Austin. </p>
