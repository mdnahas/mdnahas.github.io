  <h1>An “Average” Military would Save $833 per American per Year</h1>

<p> The USA has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population">4.3% of the world’s population</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)">24% of the world’s production</a>, but spends an outsized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures">36% of the world’s military spending</a>. In 2018, we spent <a href="https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex">$648 billion</a>.

<p> The closest country in military spending is China. <a href="https://chinapower.csis.org/military-spending/">Numbers are fuzzy</a>, but the highest estimate for 2018 was $250 billion. The USA spent more than 2.5 times that.

<p> All together, the EU has more population (6.8% of world) and roughly the same production (22% of the world). It spent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Security_and_Defence_Policy#Expenditure_and_personnel">$214 billion on the military</a>. The USA spent more than 3 times that.

<p> Our old nemesis, Russia, has shrunk and only spends $61 billion on the military, less than 10% of the USA’s budget. India and Saudi Arabia spend about as much.

<p> In short, the USA spends a lot more on the military than other countries.

<p> I like to compare costs to benefits. Unfortunately, it is hard to quantify the benefit of the military. Most of the time, tanks and planes sit around, waiting for a catastrophe. We have no way to count the invasions that didn’t happen because the USA had a large military with the best equipment in the world. While the military does produce side benefits (military research created the Internet and GPS), those are small for the cost.

<p> And our costs are high. If we chose “only” to spend twice as much as China, our closest competitor, we could save $148 billion or, using my shortcut, $444 for every American. If we spent 1.8% of our production on the military, which is what the average is worldwide, we would still have the largest military and would save $277 billion, or $833 for each adult and child in the USA, every year.

<p> <b>Details for quibblers and <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/dork-dweeb-nerd-geek-oh/">geeks</a>:</b> I try to avoid nitpicking details, but it is hard in this case. Econ geeks will notice that I used market exchange-rates to compare international spending, instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity">purchasing power parity</a> (PPP). I thought that appropriate for this usage, since arms are traded internationally at market prices. If I used the USA’s portion of the world’s production using PPP, which is 15%, it would make the 36% of military spending look even larger.

<p> The military budgets are large and diverse. Deciding what to include as “military spending” is difficult. For the USA, it includes <a href="https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/SIPRIYB16c13sII.pdf">pensions and military-related spending of the DOE and State Dept.</a>. It also includes the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/pentagon-says-afghan-war-costs-taxpayers-45-billion-per-year">approximately $45 billion</a> to support the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-preparing-to-withdraw-thousands-of-troops-from-afghanistan-in-initial-deal-with-taliban/2019/08/01/01e97126-b3ac-11e9-8f6c-7828e68cb15f_story.html">14,000 troops deployed in Afghanistan</a>. <a href="https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/SIPRIYB16c13sII.pdf">The total does not</a> include Veterans Affairs spending (<a href="https://www.va.gov/budget/docs/summary/fy2020VAbudgetInBrief.pdf">$197 billion in 2018</a>) nor intelligence agencies (<a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/what-we-do/ic-budget">$59 billion</a>). It does not include interest on the national debt. The USA spent over <a href="https://fas.org/man/eprint/cow/fy2018q2.pdf">$1,500 billion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan</a> and <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/110th-congress-2007-2008/reports/10-24-costofwar_testimony.pdf">some respected analysts include interest on money borrowed for them under military costs</a>. The interest might amount from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/24/facts-about-the-national-debt/">$37</a> to <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2018/Crawford_Costs%20of%20War%20Estimates%20Through%20FY2019.pdf">$75 billion</a> each year. If I included the VA and interest (but not the intelligence agencies), our yearly military spending is about $900 billion, or $2,700 for every adult and child in the USA.
