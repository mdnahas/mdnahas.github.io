  <h1>Return on Investment for Lobbying is 200,000%. (Not a Typo.)</h1>

<p> In <a href="2019-9-15_healthcare_spending.html">a previous post</a>, I estimated that the USA pays an unneeded $4,000 per person per year on healthcare. Using <a href="2019-8-9_three_for_every_billion.html">my rule-of-thumb that there’s 1/3 of a billion people in the USA</a>, that amounts to $1,333 billion per year in excess spending. Why are we wasting that much money?

<p> The healthcare industry spends millions on lobbying politicians. According to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?showYear=2016&indexType=i">OpenSecrets</a>, in 2016:

  <ul>
    <li> Pharmaceuticals/Health Products companies spent $247,448,814. </li>

    <li> Insurance companies spent $153,860,996.</li>
    
    <li> Hospitals/Nursing Homes spent $96,735,789.</li>
    
    <li> Health Professionals spent $84,714,166.</li>
    
    <li> Health Services/HMOs spent $76,546,293.</li>

  </ul>
  
<p> That amounts to roughly $660 million or $0.66 billion. If that’s the investment and the return is $1,333 billion, then the return-on-investment (ROI) is 201,970%. That’s a LOT better than then 5 to 7% ROI that I expect in the stock market.
