A Rant Against Economics
by Michael Nahas

I had a good career in Computer Science.  I did research, design, and implementation of high-end software, including distributed resource allocation.  I then did some work in finance and saw some hints of the structure connecting financial systems.  I wanted to study it more and entered the PhD program in Economics at The University of Texas at Austin.

I did poorly there and did not pass my PhD qualifying exams.

This is a rant.  It is driven by anger and not particularly coherant, but there's good ideas in here.  Some are about the field of economics in general.  Some are about the education at UT-Austin.  Some are about non-economists moving into the field of economics.  Many may be off base - I did only have 1.5 years experience at the lowest level of research - but I don't think they're all dismissable.  So I hope this is worth your time.


(1) Science

I was warned that getting a degree in Economics was really a degree in Applied Math.  I'm



Areas to explore:
physical limits to economics  (those are real limits)
  + entropy + chemical elements + etc.

Not "labor and capital" but
  land,
  information,
  energy,
  chemical elements,
  and
  financial resources (a special subset of information).
  note: oversight is also a subset of information
Also
  Look at transmisstion/transportation, storage, and transformation of each (except land)
