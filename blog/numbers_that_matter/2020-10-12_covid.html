  <h1>Americans Die of COVID at 5 times the Rate of Other Rich Countries</h1>

<p> With the coming election in the United States, I wanted to know how my country was doing against the COVID pandemic. I found that Americans are dying at 5 times the rate of other rich countries. Despite being <a href="https://www.ghsindex.org/">the most prepared country for a pandemic</a>, we are having one of the worse results.

<p>
<img src="2020-10-12_covid_image.png" alt="A vertical bar chart of covid deaths with 3 bars: the USA, EU, and all other rich countries. The USA's 23,335 is much larger than the EU's 7,783 and all other countries' 3,234." class="center">

<p> Actual, we’re doing 3 times worse than the EU and 5 times worse than the average rate of other rich countries. It “felt righter” to say 3 in the graphic. Created using data from Johns Hopkins University.

<p> There are many ways to measure how countries are doing against the COVID pandemic. I felt the best way was to use deaths-per-entire-population in the last month. I chose deaths because dying is the worse outcome and it is hard for a government to hide a death. (There is not just the body, but government records, funeral announcements, etc.) I chose per-population, because I wanted to compare the large USA against smaller countries. Lastly, I chose to use data from the most recent month because that would tell me how we’re doing “now”, while also averaging out the noise.

<p> I compared the USA only against other rich countries, because I had doubts about the numbers from poorer countries. I defined “rich” as making at least 1/4 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita">nominal GDP-per-person</a> of the USA. Besides the EU, this includes countries you’d expect, like Japan, the U.K., Canada, Australia, Sweden, etc..

<p> The USA was the 3rd worst rich country when measured by COVID-deaths-per-population in September 2020. The only countries worse than the USA were the Bahamas — which had a low rate before they started admitting American tourists — and Israel — which decided the situation was so bad that they’re having another lockdown.

<p> Sweden has been talked about a lot, so it is worth going into some detail. Sweden’s rate was higher than the USA’s in June of 2020. But, Sweden improved and the USA did not. In September, the USA’s COVID-deaths-per-population was more than 8 times that of Sweden. If we were doing as well as Sweden, we would have had 2,786 people die in September, instead of 23,335.

<p> My numbers support <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2029812">this statement</a> by the Editors of the New England Journal of Medicine: “… <i>although it is impossible to project the precise number of additional American lives lost because of weak and inappropriate government policies, it is at least in the tens of thousands</i> …”

<p> I cannot express how saddened and embarrassed I am by my country’s outcome. I have a number of international friends and I love bragging about America to them. But, in this test — the biggest test in my lifetime — I am ashamed at our performance. And I grieve for the unnecessary deaths.
