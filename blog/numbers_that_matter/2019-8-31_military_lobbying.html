  <h1>Military Lobbying gets $2,715 of Our Money for Every $1 Spent</h1>

<p> I recently wrote <a href="2019-8-21_military_spending.html">a story about how the USA spends dramatically more than other countries on the military</a>. Compared to China, we spend more than 2.5 times as much. Compared to Europe, we spend more than 3 times as much. Why are we spending that much?

<p> The companies that build planes, tanks, and ships spend millions lobbying Congress and giving to their campaigns. According to OpenSecrets, in 2016, they spend <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?showYear=2016&indexType=i">$71 million on lobbying</a> and <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/sectors.php">$31 million on campaigns</a>.

<p> The average country spends about 1.8% of its production on the military. If we consider that the benchmark, we’re spending an extra $277 billion. Thus, military companies are getting $2,715 of our government’s money, for each $1 they spent on our politicians.

<p> If we look at just the top 5 military contractors (<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000104&cycle=2016">Lockheed Martin</a>, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000100&cycle=2016">Boeing</a>, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000175&cycle=2016">Raytheon</a>, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000165&cycle=2016">General Dynamics</a>, and <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000170&cycle=2016">Northrop Grumman</a>), they <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/heres-where-your-tax-dollars-for-defense-are-really-going/">received $96.7 billion in contracts</a> and spent $58.5 million in lobbying and $18.8 million in campaign contributions. It’s hard to say what they would have gotten without this money, but they received $1,251 in contracts for every $1 they spent.

<p> They spent over $50 million lobbying every year for the last 10 years. I assume they feel the money is well spent.
