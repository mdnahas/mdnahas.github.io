  <h1>60% of Gun Deaths are Suicides</h1>

<p> The USA has a lot of gun deaths. While mass shootings get the headlines, they actually make up a tiny fraction of the deaths. Suicide makes up 60%.

<p> In 2017, the USA averaged <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States">109</a> deaths by gun each day. That’s more than traffic accidents which killed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year">102</a>.

<p> The majority of gun deaths are suicides, averaging 65 deaths each day.

<p> In 2017, the USA had a record number of deaths from mass shootings. Mass shootings are scary, but the total for the whole year was <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/">117</a> deaths. That year’s worth of mass shootings is exceeded by 2 days of suicides. The deadliest mass shooting in the USA was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_shooting">the attack in Las Vegas on Oct. 1ˢᵗ 2017</a>, where 58 people died. On average, more die each day from suicide than died in our worst mass shooting.

<p> Most people want to ignore suicide, thinking that it poses no harm to them. There is not just one victim in a suicide — the collateral damage hurts family, friends, and even strangers. I was hoping to find numbers on this, but I didn’t find anything I like. I can speak of what I’ve seen: A coworker drank heavily for years after someone committed suicide by walking in front of his car. A close family was chronically sad after their son’s/sibling’s intentional overdose. And a friend was traumatized after walking in on a classmate who “swallowed a shotgun”.

<p> Guns make suicide one of our most damaging diseases. In a <a href="2019-8-31_NIH.html">previous post</a>, I said the proper way to measure a disease is using DALYs. By that metric, <a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(05)00067-X/fulltext">suicide is the #9 disease in the USA</a>. <a href="https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/">More than half</a> of all suicide deaths are a result of guns. Most despondent people try to kill themselves by overdosing, poison, or cutting themselves. Luckily, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1446422/pdf/11111261.pdf">less than 2% of those attempts are successful</a>. Only 6% of suicide attempts use a gun, but those attempts are overwhelmingly fatal.

<p> <a href="https://americanhealth.jhu.edu/article/how-do-gun-laws-affect-suicide-rates">Laws can help, without taking away most guns.</a> Waiting periods <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecoj.12567">lowered suicides by 2 to 5%</a>. In Missouri, requiring a license to own a gun <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743515002297">lowered suicides by 15%</a>. So-called “red flag” laws allow police to take guns from those at risk of harming themselves or others. Police in Indianapolis seized an average 60 guns a year (in a city of roughly 1,000,000 people) and it <a href="https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1176/appi.ps.201700250">lowered the suicide rate 8%</a>.

<p> [Public Service Announcement: You can help without a law. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0805923">Suicide can be an impulsive act</a>. If you know someone at risk who owns a gun, ask them to give it to a friend for safe keeping.]

<p> The USA has a lot of gun deaths and 60% are suicides. Because of guns, suicide is a Top 10 disease. We can pass laws that deter despondent people from killing themselves, with minimal effect on most gun owners. While mass shootings do not make up a large part of gun deaths, <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/preventingattacksreport.pdf">most mass shooters have discussed or attempted suicide</a>. So, I have hope that these laws may reduce those too.
