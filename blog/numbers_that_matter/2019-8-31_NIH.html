  <h1>The National Institute of Health Spends Our Money Well</h1>


<p> My last few stories have been negative, so I thought I would do a positive one. The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the <a href="http://www.healthresearchfunders.org/health-research-funding-organizations/">biggest funder of research on disease</a>. And it seems to be doing a good job.

<p> We want the NIH to help cure the worse diseases. The good way to measure the damage done by a disease is the DALY, or Disability-Adjusted Life Years.

<p> A “life year” is a year of life lost. So, if a car crash kills someone at 29, when they were expected to live to 79, they lost 50 life years.

<p> The “disability adjusted” in DALYs means that sickness and disability are converted into life years, so that we can have a single number. So, if a disease causes you to go blind, each year of blindness might be accounted as 0.6 life years. I admit that this kind of accounting is revolting and morbid, but but it simplifies everything to a single number. (And courts make a similar decision when they decide how much money to award for causing blindness vs. killing someone.)

<p> The DALY is a way to measure how harmful a disease is to our country. And it seems the NIH is doing a good job of spending research money on the most harmful diseases.

<p> Cancer currently causes the most DALYs worth of harm and it gets the most funding. Hepatitis A does relatively little harm and gets much less funding.

<p> I don’t expect the graph of DALYs vs. research funding to form a straight line. That would mean we only assign research funding based on harm. Research money should go where there is likely to be a breakthrough that reduces that harm. For example, a new medicine has become available to treat Hepititis C — some call it “a cure” — but it is expensive. The NIH might have devoted extra research money into finding a cheaper version of the drug or how to cost-effectively use this new medicine. For the disease of “headaches”, the researchers might not expect a breakthrough that helps all headaches, so it may get less funding.

<p> This data looks like good news: government research funding is being spent on important diseases. And it’s a sizable amount of money. The NIH’s budget was <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy2018/budget-in-brief/nih/index.html">$27 billion in 2018</a>, or $81 for each American, each year.
