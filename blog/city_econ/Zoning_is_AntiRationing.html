  <h1>Our Zoning Laws are "Anti-Rationing"</h1>

  I've been struggling to explain to non-economists why our zoning laws are so wrong.  And I think I've hit on how to explain it to them.  The explanation starts by talking about water.
  <p>
    In the last 5 years, Austin Texas has had three water shortages.  The water plants stopped working due to flooding, freezing, and user error.  Each time, Austinites needed bottled water.
    <p>
      Austin's largest grocer, HEB, had bottled water.  It also had a friendly reputation, and wanted to preserve that by getting water cheaply to all its customers.  HEB didn't want a panicky rich person to buy lots of the water.  And it didn't want a profiteer to buy all the water cheap and extort the thirsty.  So, HEB rationed the water.  They limited purchases to 2 cases of bottled water per customer.
      <p>
	Rationing made sense.  There was a shortage of a necessity and HEB got that necessity to more people by putting a maximum limit on how much each customer could purchase.
	<p>
	  Now, enough with water, let's jump back to housing and land.
	  <p>
	    Housing and land are also necessities: everyone needs housing and land for that housing.  They are in shortage in Austin: rents and land prices are high.  The obvious conclusion is that, if we want everyone to get housing and land, we should ration housing and land.  We should have a maximum apartment size and a maximum lot size.
	    <p>
	      But Austin does not have that.  We have a minimum apartment size and a minimum lot size.  We have the exact opposite of rationing.  We have anti-rationing.
	      <p>
		Anti-rationing is a policy that indulges, even forces, panicky rich people into buying too much.  It is a policy that enables, even encourages, extortionists to drive up prices.  It is a policy to cause shortages.  And the evidence is the homeless in our streets.
		<p>
		  That is why our zoning laws feel so wrong to an economist like me.  I don't want to distort the market, but, if we were going to distort the market, our current policy, anti-rationing, is the exact opposite of anything that makes sense.  I'm horrified to think about HEB anti-rationing water.  We need to stop anti-rationing of housing and land.
