<h3 id="BlueberryBuckle">Blueberry Buckle</h3>
<span style="font-style: italic;"> Once again, in the master's own
words:</span><br/>
<br/>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">It's always so nice to feel wanted by
my children. Here's the recipe and a few pointers. As you may recall, I
often freeze blueberries, and due to my impatientce or whatever,
usually don't defrost them before making the buckle. This usually works
just fine - however, the baking time is a little longer. The way to
test doneness is to insert a wooden toothpick into the cake near the
middle. (Basically, any thing with a thin tip that won't melt will
work, including a knife.) If the cake is done, it will come out
relatively clean if the batter is still gooey, it will stick to the
toothpick. You may want to pick over the blueberries to remove the
stems and any rotten ones. For ones I've picked myself, I usually don't
wash them, as I pick from the top of the bushes. If you want to wash
your purchased ones, make sure they have had a chance to dry on some
paper towels before adding them to the batter. And if you put any in
the freezer, don't wash them first - wash them when you are ready to
use them. I use the 811 pan - use whatever you have. If it is 911,
check for doneness a bit sooner. Also, you may want to adjust the
baking time if you are using a glass/Corning ware type pan. I think it
requires a little longer at a lower temp, but I need to check on this
for you.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BLUEBERRY BUCKLE</span><br/>
<br/>
1/4 cup butter/margarine, softened <br/>
2 cups flour<br/>
1 cup sugar <br/>
2 teaspoons baking powder<br/>
1 egg <br/>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br/>
1/2 cup milk<br/>
2 cups blueberries<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TOPPING</span> - same one I use for
Apple Crisp and crumb pies.<br/>
<br/>
1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened <br/>
1/2 cup sugar<br/>
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon - or more <br/>
1/3 cup flour<br/>
<br/>
Grease and flour an 8" or 9" square pan. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Cream together butter and sugar. <br/>
Beat in egg. <br/>
Add milk and mix slowly. <br/>
Sift together dry ingredients and stir into batter. <br/>
Fold in blueberries. <br/>
Spread batter in pan.<br/>
<br/>
To make topping, put all ingerdients in a small bowl. You can use a
fork to "cut" butter into dry mixture until it resembles crumbs.<br/>
<br/>
Spoon crumbs evenly over batter in pan.<br/>
<br/>
Bake 45 min. or until cake is done. Place pan on rack to cool.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy.<br/>

<h3 id="ContinentalCasserole">Continential Casserole (egg dish that Mom served to crowds) (From ND Cookbook)</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
6 slices bacon<br/>
3 cups croutons (Try to get the ones that are about 1/2” cubes, NOT the 1” cubes.  Also, you can use plain , cheese, or cheese and garlic flavored.) <br/>
8 oz. Sharp Cheddar Cheese, shredded (You can use the low fat cheese if are being health conscious, but don't use the no fat.) you <br/>
6 large eggs <br/>
3 cups milk (Skim is OK if you are being health conscious; 2% is better; whole milk is richer yet, but not necessary) <br/>
1 teaspoon salt <br/>
3/4 teaspoon prepared mustard <br/>
1/4 teaspoon onion powder <br/>
Fresh ground pepper (to taste) <br/>
<br/>
Cook, drain, and crumble the bacon.  (This can be done the day before.) (Mom snips the slices with my kitchen shears.)<br/>
<br/>
Greased 2 quart ceramic casserole dish. <br/>
Layer croutons and sprinkle with cheese. <br/>
Combine remaining ingredients (beat with hand mixer) and pour over croutons and cheese. <br/>
Sprinkle bacon on top. <br/>
Bake immediately, uncovered, at 325 degrees Fahrenheit for about 45 minutes, until knife inserted near center comes out clean. <br/>
<br/>
NOTE: The recipe doubles easily for a larger pan.  Allow up to 15 minutes longer to bake.<br/>

THe Hollandaise sauce is a fairly standard sauce -&gt;it'll be in any
Joy of Cooking Cookbook.<br/>
<br/>
The muffins with which the crabcakes are made is another matter --
they've got whole grain flour and cornmeal in them. Again, standard
muffins... with a little clove and nutmeg thrown in (very little bit).
You want them to be very soft and moist (check JOC).<br/>

Crush up some muffins and add some crabmeat (minus gristly stuff) and
mush them all together until you get a nice crabby-muffiny paste. (A
teensy bit of egg helps).<br/>
<br/>
Make patties and place them on a lightly (I mean LIGHTLY) pammed
skillet until they are cooked to your satisfaction (I prefer them a
little on the browner side).<br/>
<br/>
Put a couple of English muffins in the toaster and poach two eggs. Put
the English muffins on a plate, put a crabcake on each muffin, then
carefully put one egg on each cake and cover with Hollandaise sauce...
then add some parsley and voila! You have Mike Paine's Eggs Chesapeake.
It is damn good isn't it?<br/>

##########################################<br/>
Tried this recipe for Christmas 2001<br/>
Here what I did:<br/>
2/3 cup flour<br/>
2/3 cup whole wheat flour<br/>
2/3 cup cornmeal<br/>
1/4 tsp. nutmeg<br/>
1/4 tsp. ground clove<br/>
1 tsp. salt<br/>
2 tsp. baking powder<br/>
<br/>
beat together.<br/>
1 egg<br/>
2 Tbsp. honey or molasses<br/>
1 cup milk<br/>
2-3 tsp. melted butter<br/>
<br/>
Had 10 muffins + 2 eggs + 2 lbs. crab meat (counting gristle, which was
removed)<br/>
Made 12 crabcakes.<br/>
Cooked at 5 minutes per side at 270 degrees on electric fry pan.<br/>
<br/>
Results:<br/>
Crabcakes were too big - shrink by about 1/3.<br/>
Also had too much crab flavor - reduce the crab by more than 1/3.
(maybe only use 1 lb.?)<br/>
<br/>
In 2020, I did 2 lbs. crab with 1.5 times muffin recipe.  It needed 4 jumbo eggs to stick together.  Came out great!  Made 24 crab cakes.  Served on lightly toasted English muffins (which I almost forgot!) with poached egg and Hollandaise sause.<br/>

<h3 id="ChexMix">Chex Mix alla Frannie (extra butter, extra spice ... the good stuff!)  (author is not responsible for addiction.)</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  You need a large roasting pan. (And a 2.5 cup measuring cup helps!) <br/>
  <br/>
  1 cup butter (2 sticks)<br/>
  10 Tbsp (2/3 cup) Worcestershire sauce<br/>
  5 tsp Garlic Powder<br/>
  5 tsp Onion Powder<br/>
  <br/>
  1 16 oz jar unsalted roasted peanuts (~2.5 cups)<br/>
  ~5 cups Mini Pretzels<br/>
  ~5-6 cups Corn Chex<br/>
  ~5-6 cups Rice Chex<br/>
  ~2.5 cups Wheat Chex<br/>
  ~2.5 cups Cheerios<br/>
  <br/>
  NOTE: If you use a 2.5 cup measuring cup, it’s easy. It’s one each of Wheat Chex and Cheerios, two each of Corn Chex, Rice Chex, and Pretzels, plus extra Chex to fill the pan. <br/>
  <br/> 
  Turn on the oven to 250 degrees.<br/>
  Put the butter in the roasting pan and put in the over to melt.<br/>
  While the butter is melting, measure out the Chex, Peanuts, Cheerios, and Pretzels into the big bowl (or
multiple bowls if you don’t have one big enough). <br/>
  Once the butter is melted, take out of the oven and add the Worcestershire, garlic powder, and onion powder to the pan and stir. <br/>
  Pour the Chex mix into the pan. <br/>
  Stir gently until everything is coated. <br/>
  Add more Corn and/or Rice Chex to fill the pan. Stir gentle to incorporate. <br/>
  For added spice or if it’s a big pan, sprinkle the top with a little extra Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and onion powder. <br/>
  Cook for 1 hour total, stopping to stir every 15 minutes. <br/>
  While the Chex mix is cooking, set out 3-5 sheet pans and cover with paper towels. <br/>
  When the Chex mix is done, spread on the sheet pans to cool. <br/>

<h3 id="JensButternutSoup">Jen's Butternut Soup</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
1 butternut squash - peeled, deseeded, and cubed<br/>
1 large sweet onion - diced<br/>
1 apple - this controls the sweetness of the soup, so choose the type of apple according to your preference - peeled, cored, and diced<br/>
veg broth (though you can use anykind)<br/>
salt and pepper<br/>
(cayenne and cumin) or (peri peri and cumin) or (nutmeg and sugar)<br/>
<br/>
My mother uses nutmeg and a little sugar instead of cayenne and cumin, for a very different flavor profile, also good, though I prefer it more savory.<br/>
<br/>
Dump prepared squash, onion, and apple in a pot and cover with broth <br/> 
Simmer for an hour <br/>
Check to see if squash is soft, if not, simmer longer <br/>
Season <br/>
Modify consistency as per desire - I used to use a mason jar to mash the 'solid' components of the soup, ending up with a kind of lumpy yellow soup. Now I use an emersion blender on low, so it is smoother but still thick. My mom puts it in a blender. <br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
If you refrigerate the leftover, it tends to loose some liquid and become very thick, so I add a little water or broth before reheating. Also freezes well.<br/>

<h3 id="ChickenBarleySoup">Chicken Barley Soup</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
2 tsp. olive oil<br/>
4 Green onions chopped, with white and green parts divided<br/>
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken cut into &frac12; inch pieces<br/>
1 teaspoon dried thyme<br/>
2 bay leaves<br/>
3 14.5-ounce cans reduced-sodium chicken broth<br/>
2/3 cup quick-cooking barley<br/>
&frac12; cup frozen corn<br/>
&frac12; cup frozen peas<br/>
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley<br/>
Salt and ground black pepper <br/>
<br/>
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Add white part of
the onion and cook 1 minute. Add chicken and cook 3 minutes, until
browned on all sides, stirring frequently. Toss in thyme and bay leaves
and stir to coat chicken and onion. <br/>
Add broth and barley and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and
simmer 10 minutes, until tender. Stir in corn and peas and simmer 1
minute longer. Remove from heat and stir in parsley and green part of
the onion. <br/>
Notes:<br/>
<ol>
  <li>Also good with quinoa instead of barley.</li>
  <li>Also good with cilantro instead of parsley.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3 id="LentilSoup">Lentil Soup</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
2 T. olive oil<br/>
1 yellow onion finely chopped<br/>
1 celery stalk, thinly sliced<br/>
1 carrot, peeled and thinly sliced<br/>
1 clove garlic minced<br/>
1 bay leaf<br/>
2 t. curry powder<br/>
2 cup canned diced plum tomatoes, with juice<br/>
1 cup dried brown or pink lentils, rinsed and drained<br/>
6 cups chicken stock<br/>
1 lemon sliced<br/>
1 cup coarsely chopped fresh spinach<br/>
Salt and pepper to taste<br/>
<br/>
In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, warm the oil. Add the onion,
celery, carrot, garlic, and bay leaf and saut&eacute; until the
vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the curry powder and
cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.<br/>
Add the tomatoes and their juice, lentils, stock, and lemon slices.
Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low,
cover partially, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are
tender, about 30 minutes. Discard the lemon slices and bay leaf. <br/>
Just before serving, stir in the spinach, reduce the heat to low and
simmer until the spinach is wilted but still bright green. Season to
taste with salt and pepper.<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>

<h3 id="TortillaSoup">Tortilla Soup</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
&frac12; cup plus 2 T. vegetable oil<br/>
1 yellow onion thinly sliced<br/>
2 cloves garlic<br/>
&frac14; cup plus 2 t. chopped fresh cilantro<br/>
1 cup drained canned plum tomatoes<br/>
&frac12; t. ground cumin<br/>
4 cups chick stock<br/>
1 skinless, boneless whole chicken breast (@ &frac12; pound) cut into
bite-sized strips<br/>
Salt and pepper<br/>
4 corn tortillas<br/>
1 dried chile, such as ancho, seeded<br/>
1 avocado, pitted, peeled, and diced<br/>
&frac14; cup shredded Monterey jack cheese<br/>
2 t. fresh lime juice<br/>
<br/>
In a frying pan, over medium heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add
the onion, garlic, and the 2 teaspoons cilantro and saut&eacute; just
until golden brown, about 10 minutes.<br/>
In a blender or food processor, combine the saut&eacute;ed mixture and
the tomatoes and process until smooth. <br/>
In the same frying pan over medium-high heat, warm another tablespoon
of the oil. Add the tomato mixture and cumin. Cook, stirring
frequently, until thickened and darkened, 5-6 minutes. <br/>
Transfer the mixture to a large saucepan over medium-high heat and add
the stock. Cover partially and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the
soup is slightly thickened, about 20 minutes. Add the chicken strips
and simmer until they are just opaque throughout, 2-3 minutes longer.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.<br/>
While the soup is cooking, cut the tortillas in half and slice each
half into thin strips. In a frying pan over medium-high heat, warm the
&frac12; cup vegetable oil. Drop a tortilla strip in the oil and if it
sizzles immediately, the oil is ready. Drop handfuls of the tortilla
strips into the oil and fry, turning with tongs, until crisp and
browned, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper
towels to drain.<br/>
In a small, dry frying pan over medium heat, toast the chile until
fragrant, about 7 minutes. Shake the pan often; do not let the chile
burn. Let cool, then crumble and set aside. <br/>
To serve, ladle the soup into warmed bowls. Divide the tortilla strips,
crumbles chile, the &frac14; cup cilantro, the avocado, cheese, and
lime juice evenly among the bowls and serve immediately.<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Notes: <br/>
<ol>
  <li>I sometimes add a little tomato paste to help thicken.</li>
  <li>Add more cilantro to the base if you like a stronger flavor.</li>
  <li>To simplify, instead of roasting the chile, just use some ancho
chile powder (not your generic mixed chile powder) and sprinkle a
little to taste in soup? be careful, it can get very spicy very quickly
this way!</li>
  <li>Instead of frying the tortilla strips, bake tortilla strips
instead. Healthier and easier! 400 for 7-8 minutes. Watch carefully?
they take a while to brown, then go to black very quickly! </li>

<h3 id="PearPomegranateSalad">Pear Pomegranate Salad (alla Frannie)</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <i>I didn't measure anything, so the measurements are guesses for the salad I made Friday for our family, which used just 1 pear.</i><br/>
  Baby spinach<br/>
  ~1/3 c. Pecan halves<br/>
  1/2 container crumbled goat cheese<br/>
  1 Bijou pear (Bijou are better than Bartlett's for the salad, since they're firmer)<br/>
  Lemon juice<br/>
  Seeds of 1/2 of a large Pomegranate<br/>
  <br/>
  <i>Dressing ingredients:</i><br/>
  ~1/4 c. Olive oil<br/>
  ~1/6 c. Balsamic<br/>
  ~1/2 tbsp Honey<br/>
  ~1 tbsp Whole grain mustard<br/>
  Salt & pepper<br/>
  <br/>
  Add the dressing ingredients into a jar and shake. Taste and add more of whatever is needed. I tried to keep the ratio of mustard to honey 2-1, so that the dressing wasn't too sweet on top of the pears and pomegranates. Note: these amounts make extra dressing - you won't need this all for one salad.<br/>
  Toast the pecans in a dry pan for a few minutes until they start to brown.<br/>
  Seed the Pomegranate if you start with a whole one.*<br/>
  Core and slice the pear into thin slices. Put a little lemon juice on them to keep them from browning.<br/>
  Dress the spinach (you won't use all the dressing - just make sure the leaves are coated). Add some of the pecans, pomegranates, and goat cheese and toss. Arrange the pear slices on top of the salad and garnish with the remaining pecans, pomegranates, and goat cheese.<br/>
  <br/>
  *To seed the pomegranate: Cut off the top and bottom, then slice through the skin vertically top to bottom on each of the ridges (usually 5 slices). Gently pull apart. Fill a mixing bowl with water. Submerge a piece of the pomegranate and gently pull the seeds away from the rind. The seeds will fall to the bottom of the bowl and the rind will float. Repeat until you've seeded the whole pomegranate. Skim the rind off the top, scan the seeds for bits of rind and clean them. Skim the rind again. Repeat until the seeds look clean. Pour into a mesh strainer to drain the water.<br/>

<span style="font-style: italic;">In mom's own words:</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<br/>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Here's how I do the brisket.<br/>
<br/>
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.<br/>
Place the brisket in a roasting pan and cover the pan with aluminum<br/>
foil, folding over the edges to seal.<br/>
Bake for 2 hours, for a brisket about 4-5 pounds. (Adjust according to<br/>
weight, with an 8-10 pound brisket taking 4 hours.)<br/>
After the two hours, carefully uncover the meat and drain off the<br/>
liquid. (Be careful not to burn yourself from the steam as your uncover<br/>
the meat, or from the hot juices.)<br/>
Spoon 2 cups of barbecue sauce over top and sides of the meat and<br/>
recover with the foil.<br/>
Bake for 2 hours, checking occasionally to see if more barbecue sauce is<br/>
needed. (Adjust time accordingly for larger brisket, up to 4 hours.)<br/>
To serve, cut across the grain of the meat.<br/>
<br/>
I use a "from scratch" barbecue sauce. Let me know if you want the<br/>
recipe for another time.<br/>

<h3 id="TurkeyChili">Turkey Chili (from <a href="https://www.chowhound.com/recipes/easy-spicy-turkey-chili-30668">Chowhound</a>, but similar to Margaret's) (Easy; takes about an hour.)</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
2 tablespoons vegetable oil <br/>
1 medium red bell pepper, medium dice <br/>
1 medium yellow onion, medium dice <br/>
2 medium garlic cloves, coarsely chopped <br/>
1 pound ground turkey <br/>
3 tablespoons chili powder <br/>
2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed <br/>
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano <br/>
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin <br/>
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper <br/>
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon <br/>
1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes <br/>
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth or stock <br/>
2 (14-ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed <br/>
1 bay leaf <br/>
<br/>
Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. <br/>
Add the bell pepper, onion, and garlic, season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have softened.  (About 5 to 8 minutes.) <br/>
Increase the heat to medium high, add the turkey, and cook.  Break up the turkey into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon, until it’s no longer pink and is just cooked through.  (About 4 to 6 minutes.) <br/>
Add the chili powder, measured salt, oregano, cumin, cayenne, and cinnamon.  Stir to coat the turkey and vegetables, and cook until fragrant.  (About 1 minute.) <br/>
Add the tomatoes with their juices, and the broth or stock.  Stir to combine, and bring to a simmer. <br/>
Add the beans and return to a simmer. <br/>
Add the bay leaf. Reduce the heat to medium low.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the flavors meld.  (About 30 minutes.) <br/>
Remove the bay leaf. Taste and season with additional salt as needed. Serve with the cheese and sour cream on top.  I love eating it with Fritos Scoops.<br/>

<h3 id="Kibby">Kibby (pronounced &quot;kib-ba&quot;) (Syrian/Lebonese meat dish)</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  1 lb. ground lamb or beef, (no leaner than 85%)*<br/>
  1 cup #2 cracked wheat <br/>
  1 large onion, sliced <br/>
  1-2 tsp. cinnamon <br/>
  1/4 cup pignola nuts - optional <br/>
  <br/>
  Cover cracked wheat with water and let soak to soften while you ... <br/>
  Grease baking dish and ... <br/>
  Saute onion, pine nuts, cinnamon, and no more than 1/4 lb. of the meat in a fry pan until onion begins to brown. <br/>
  Mix cracked wheat and ground meat. Add extra cold water if needed.<br/>
  Take about half of the mixture and pat it into the bottom of your baking dish. Cover with the onion mixture.  Top with the remaining ground meat mixture - flatten portions of it in your hands and use to cover the onion mixture, patting sections together until you have a solid surface. <br/>
  Cut through on the diagonal, and then in parallel lines until you have made diamond-shaped
portions. <br/>
  Bake at 350F about 1/2 hour. <br/>
  <br/>
  NOTES:<br/>
  * You might even want to use ground chuck. With the leaner meat, the result is too dry. <br/>
  Use a ceramic 8 inch square ( or equivalent) baking dish. I have used my 1 1/2 qt. corning ware dish, and also another dish that is about 10 x 6, which means that the kibby is not quite so thick, but it works. I don&#39;t bake it quite so long so it doesn&#39;t dry out. <br/>
  Recipe doubles easily <br/>

Clams (little neck, small, 8 to 12 per person)<br/> 
can of white clam sauce, 15oz<br/>
4 or 5 cloves of garlic<br/>
olive oil<br/>
parsley<br/>
dry white wine (e.g., Pinot Grigio), 3 ounces<br/>
pecarino romano cheese, grated (you'll use a lot)  <br/> 
linguini, 1 lb<br/> 
<br/>
Start water boiling for linguini, and cook it as usual.<br/>  
<br/>
Rinse clams.  Get sand and dirt off them.
<br/>  
Put clams into wide pot or deep pan.  (E.g., a 16 qt. spaghetti pot) <br/>
Add a little water (less than halfway up the clams)<br/>
Boil.  Keep moving and flipping the clams to heat them evenly.<br/> 
As clams open, immediately remove them with tongs and put them aside.  (If any don't open, throw them away!)<br/> 
KEEP THE WATER (If there's sand and grit in the bottom, you can pour the liquid part into a sauce pot)<br/>  
<br/>  
Chop the garlic in thick slices.<br/> 
Put garlic into small microwaveable dish<br/>  
Pour enough olive oil to submerge garlic<br/>
Cover<br/>
Microwave until it bubbles (30 to 60 seconds)  (This brings out flavor of garlic.)<br/>
<br/>
Put garlic and olive oil into clam water<br/>
Add can of white clam sauce (The can is an easy way to get spices.)<br/>
Add half a glass of wine<br/>

<h3 id="MeatLoaf">Meat Loaf</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
1.25 lb. lean ground beef<br/>
1 to 2 eggs<br/>
Chopped celery 1/2 cup-ish (including the leaves)<br/>
1 medium onion<br/>
Chopped parsley<br/>
Dash of Worcestershire<br/>
3-5 slices of damp bread<br/>
15 oz. can of Hunt's chunky tomato sauce<br/>

Shape into a loaf<br/>
Grease pan<br/>
Put loaf on pan<br/>
Cook 45 minutes @ 400 degrees.<br/>
Dump sauce on top of loaf<br/>
Cook 15 more minutes. <br/>
  <br/>
  Mom's Notes:<br/>
  Recipe doubles easily. If you are in a hurry, form into two loaves for baking. Otherwise, figure on 1 1/2 hours for baking time. <br/>
I sometimes include some powdered milk and a 1/4 cup of wheat germ, just for nutritional sake. <br/>
White breads and wheat breads work well - although I usually try to include some white bread. Rye bread and sour dough bread give a different flavor, so I don&#39;t use them. I&#39;ve used &quot;old&quot; hamburger or hot dog rolls also, if I&#39;ve had some left over. I don&#39;t like to use Italian type breads or rolls - the crust never breaks up enough to mix in easily. Some people use bread crumbs, but they give the loaf a different texture. You may recall that I also added the &quot;crumbs&quot; from the Chex cereals that I would collect - but usually for the double recipe where their flavor wouldn&#39;t dominate - and where there were at least also a couple of slices of bread. <br/>
Sometimes, I would dice up some cheese and mix it into the meatload, if I had some stray pieces in the fridge - usually cheddar, colby, monterey jack. You can experiment a little if you want to.<br/>

<h3 id="SteamedMussels">Steamed Mussels (for linguine) from Margaret</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
2 lbs. live mussels (I bought Prince Edward Island mussels at HEB.) <br/>
1 cup dry white wine (I used about 1 1/4 cup of leftover Prosecco.) <br/>
2 large shallots, finely chopped (1 bulb) <br/>
2 fresh garlic cloves, finely chopped (If not fresh, use more.) <br/>
1/4 tsp of sea salt <br/>
2 tsp of lemon juice <br/>
1/4 cup of fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley <br/>
6 Tbs of butter <em>divided in half</em> (I used the unsalted Kelley Gold butter.) <br/>
<br/>
Rinse and scrub mussels under cold water. <br/>
Using fingers and a paring knife, remove beards (strings that hang from the mussel shells) and discard.  (HEB already did this step for me. Yay!) <br/>
In a large stock pot set over medium heat combine: wine, shallots, garlic, salt, lemon juice and <em>half</em> the butter. <br/>
Simmer for 5 minutes on a low boil. <br/>
Add mussels, cover, and increase heat to high <br/>
Cook until all the mussels are open. This is about 5 minutes. (Some mussels may never open and that’s ok.) <br/>
Remove the mussels into a serving dish and leave the liquid.  (Discard unopened mussels.)<br/>
Stir in the remaining butter and the parsley. <br/>
Once the butter is melted, pour the liquid over the mussels. <br/>
Serve immediately over linguine or with fresh bread. <br/>

Pepperidge farms herb seasoned stuffing <br/>
applesauce<br/>
raisins<br/>
cheese<br/>
cinnamon<br/>
+ pairs of matching porkchops (thin cut = half-inch thick)<br/>
<br/>
Mix ingredients for stuffing.  I would guess 6 parts stuffing to 2 parts cheese to 1 part raisins (by volume).  Lots of cinnamon.  Enough applesauce so that it sticks together and is damp.<br/>
Place stuffing between pairs of porkchops on oven pan.  It's basically a sandwich where the porkchops are the bread and the stuffing is the filling.  <br/>
Cook at 400 degrees until chops are throughly done.  (Lift the largest upper porkchop to see if it is cooked on its stuffing-side.)<br/>

<h3 id="Yebra">Yebra (Syrian/Lebonese stuffed grape leaves)</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  30+ grape leaves, jarred or fresh.* <br/>
  1 cup rice (UNCOOKED - will cook inside grape leaf)<br/>
  1 lb. ground lamb or beef (no leaner than 85%)** <br/>
  1/2 tsp. allspice <br/>
  1/2 tsp. garlic powder <br/>
  1 Tbsp tomato paste <br/>
  8-10 garlic cloves <br/>
  Lemon juice. Fresh is best. About 2 Tbsp. fresh, so 1-2 lemons, depending on size. <br/>
  <br/>
  If you're using fresh grape leaves, cover them with boiling water and let sit for 15 min. or so to soften. <br/>
  <br/>
  6 Qt. Dutch oven works well <br/>
  Combine ground meat, rice and spices, mixing well. <br/>
  If you're using jarred grape leave, rinse them in warm water. <br/>
  Drain grape leaves. <br/>
  <br/>
  To make each roll:<br/>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    Take a grape leaf and cut out stem. If very thick, cut a little bit up past where leaf starts.<br/>
    Lay leaf flat on work surface, with veined side down, and (former) stem end toward you. <br/>
    Overlap the bottoms of the leaf to cover where the stem was cut out. <br/>
    Take a little of the ground meat mixture and form a little cigar-shaped roll. (Amount will depend on size of leaf.) <br/>
    Place on grape leaf, perpendicular to the &quot;stem.&quot;. <br/>
    Fold bottom and sides of grape leaf inwards to cover, and then roll away from you, using a slight amount of pressure. <br/>
  </div>
  As you work, take the leaves that are not so nice and lay some on the bottom of the pot you are using. You will need to cover the bottom of the pot and a little way up the sides. <br/>
  When finished rolling, put the rolls in the pot, in rows, packing tightly.  (You don't want leaves to unroll.) Alternate direction of rolls for each layer. Put garlic cloves in among the rolls. <br/>
  You need to put something on top of the rolls to hold them down while they cook - either a dish or sometimes I use the removable bottom of a cake pan, in which case I put a CorningWare dish filled with water on top of that. <br/>
  Add lemon juice and enough water to cover the grape leaves/reach the dish. <br/>
  Cover pot, bring to boil, lower heat, and cook about 20 min. - more if you like your rice softer.  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serve hot or cold.  Can use lemon juice they were cooked in to dip/sauce.<br/>
  Makes about 20-24. <br/>
  * Larger jars, with 3 sets of rolled leaves, have about 60-75 leaves. Smaller jars have about 35 leaves. (NEED TO VERIFY THESE COUNTS.) <br/>
  ** You might even want to use ground chuck - with the leaner meat, the result is too dry.<br/>
</div>

<h3 id="Pasta">Homemade Pasta (lasagna noodles, spaghetti, etc.) </h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  3 cups of flour (I used "all-purpose")<br/>
  4 large eggs<br/>
  <br/>
  Use a large counter or cutting board.<br/>
  Put the flour on it in a ring, making a "volcano".<br/>
  Crack the eggs into the center of the ring/volcano.<br/>
  Scramble the eggs  with a fork and slowly add more and more flour to the mix.<br/>
  When it is all mixed, form a ball of dough.<br/>
  Flour the counter.<br/>
  Kneed the ball of dough for 2 to 3 minutes.<br/>
  Ball of dough should be dry but also stay together as a ball, not crumble.  Add flour or egg/water as needed. <br/>
  Wrap in plastic wrap and let sit for 20 minutes.<br/>
  Make your pasta: roll out, run through machine, and cut!<br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="font-style: italic;"> Makes 1 lb. of pasta.  That's good for 1 lasagna at the thinnest setting ("6" on my machine).  I think next time, I'll use twice as much and make thicker noodles. </span><br/>

<h3 id="SpaghettiSauce">Spaghetti Sauce (tomato sauce)</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  8 boxes of Strained Tomatoes 26oz (750g) (Mom used Pomi brand)<br/>
  2 cans of Tomato Sauce 15oz (Mom uses Hunts or Contadina)<br/>
  4 cans of Tomato Paste 6oz (Mom used Contadina)<br/>
  1 whole-damn-bulb of garlic (20+ cloves?!)<br/>
  2 medium-large onions<br/>
  8 to 12 sprigs of parsley (leaves and some stems)<br/>
  12 large basil leaves<br/>
  Oregano (optional)<br/>
  Red pepper (optional) <br/>
  2 lb. ground beef <br/>
  lamb shank (optional) <br/>
  cheese (1/2 Parmesan, 1/2 Romano) (if no dairy issues)<br/>
  8oz of mushrooms (Mom used "white" variety) (if no Fran)<br/>
  <br/>
  Get a 12 quart pot.<br/>
  Add tomatoes, sauce, paste, parsley and basil.<br/>
  (Optional) Add oregano, red pepper and any other spices. <br/>
  (Optional) Add cheese. <br/>
  Start heat, usually at low - it is very easy to burn if not stirring often!<br/>
  In a fry pan, saute onions and mushrooms in olive oil.<br/>
  Later, add crushed garlic to fry pan (it will burn if added early). <br/>
  Keep frying until onions are soft, almost mushy.<br/>
  Add fry pan contents to pot.<br/>
  Fry ground beef (not browned - do not make it crispy)<br/>
  Drain ground beef and add to pot.<br/>
  (Optional) Add lamb shank. <br/>
  Simmer for 3 hours, while stirring occasionally.<br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="font-style: italic;"> If you make meatballs, you can cook them and add them to the pot too.  With meatballs, she usually uses less ground beef.  You can also saute sausage and add it to the sauce. </span><br/>

Mix ingredients.  The amount of breadcrumbs varies, depending on meat and eggs.  The resulting mixture was pretty firm.<br/>
Roll into balls, 1 1/4" to 1 1/2" in diameter.<br/>
Saute in olive oil.  If you're throwing them in sauce, just crisp the outsides and let center cook in sauce pot.<br/>

<h3 id="Lasagna">Lasagna</h3>
<span style="font-style: italic;"> As written out for my friend,
Stephanie, who was in Mexico (hence the metric measurements)</span><br/>
<br/>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Let's see - my recipe for Lasagna.
Hold on - I'll go dig for it...<br/>
<br/>
Here we go... (uncrinkles 7 year old sheet of paper) The cheese part
(just mix it all together) is:<br/>
<br/>
1.5 lb (750g) of Ricotta cheese<br/>
.75 lb (375g) of Shreaded mozzarella cheese<br/>
3 (3) eggs<br/>
Parsley <br/>
3/4 cup (???) of grated Parmesan cheese<br/>
<br/>
Let's see 3/4 cup is 3/8 pint, which is 3/16 quart. A quart is almost a
liter. So, between .15 and .2 liters.<br/>
<br/>
You'll need about 16-18 sheets of normal lasagna pasta. (I used 9
super-sheets that I got from a local Italian deli.)<br/>
And a big bottle of sauce (I think it's like 32 oz (1kg).) Sometimes I
needed a little more than one.<br/>
<br/>
So.....<br/>
<br/>
Sauce the dish - this will prevent it from sticking later.<br/>
lay down a layer of noodles. Make them hang over the edge of the pan.
At the end, you fold these over the top so it looks like it's just one
big thing.<br/>
Lay down layers as you please - I usually do this:<br/>
sauce<br/>
noodles<br/>
Thick layer of cheese (about 2/3 of mixture)<br/>
noodles<br/>
sauce + filling (sausage &amp; meatballs for me, probably sauteed
squash for you)<br/>
noodles<br/>
thin layer of cheese (about 1/3 of mixture)<br/>
noodles<br/>
noodles + sauce (uses up remaining noodles and most of sauce)<br/>
After the final layer of noodles, fold the ones you left hanging off
the edge over the top.<br/>
Then I add a bit of sauce to get the top and sides wet and sprinkle
some Parmesan on top. <br/>
<br/>
That's about it!<br/>
<br/>
If you don't want to do so much, you can do lasagna rolls. This is what
my mom does for small groups.<br/>
You need the same cheese mixture (only less of it), sauce (less of that
too), and some spinach.<br/>
You lay out a sheet of lasagna pasta, cover it in sauce, then spinach,
then cheese mixture. <br/>
Roll it up. They usually end up being about the size of a fist. (5ish
centimeters in diameter)<br/>
Pack them in a pan and then cover them in more sauce. <br/>
<br/>
Ahhh yes - let me not forget to tell you how to cook it! Preheat the
oven and then bake if for 325 Fahrenheit (163 Celsius) for 30 minutes
(500 millihours). :) If you build it really thick, like I tend to do,
it may take longer. <br/>

<h3 id="ChocolateFrosting">Chocolate Frosting</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
1 lb. powdered sugar (1 box)<br/>
1 stick butter<br/>
1 tsp vanilla<br/>
1 egg<br/> 
pinch of salt<br/>
4 tubes of Nestle Choco-bake (if you can find it!)<br/>
milk (enough &quot;for spreading consistency&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Made in food processor.  Add first 5 ingredients.  Blend. <br/>
  Then add chocolate. <br/>
  Add milk as needed.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: Instead of Choco-bake, tried 8 oz. of Ghiradelli unsweetened chocolate.  Came out bitter.
  Maybe try semi-sweet or milk-chocolate?  Chocolate was melted before
  adding to mixture.  Be careful not to burn chocolate in the
  microwave.  I melted chocolate by microwaving at 50% power for 1.5
  minutes, then stirring, and repeating that until done.  <br/>
<br/>
NOTE: Next time, can replace each tube/envelope of Choco-Bake with 3
  Tbps of cocoa powder and 1 Tbps of vegitable oil or butter.  So, 12
  Tbps of cocoa powder and 4 of oil/butter.<br/>

<h3 id="Manhattan">Manhattan</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  5 parts bourbon<br/>
  1 part sweet vermouth<br/>
  1 part dry vermouth<br/>
  dash of bitters<br/>
  maraschino cherries<br/>

  Shake.<br/>
  Pour into glass.<br/>
  Add cherries.<br/>

<h3 id="MaraschinoCherries">Maraschino Cherries</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  3 lbs. Bing cherries<br/>
  12 jars, 8-ounces each<br/> 
  750ml (3.17 cups) Maraschino Liqueur (I used Luxardo) <br/>
  3 cups water<br/>  
  3 cups sugar<br/>  
  1 medium lemon (juice AND peel)<br/>
  1.5 tsp almond extract<br/>
  1 cinnamon stick<br/> 
  1 vanilla bean<br/> 
  .5 tsp ground ginger<br/> 
  <br/> 
  Pit the cherries.  (Careful, stems are fragile.  I used an Oxo pitter.  It seemed best to go sidewise through the cherry.  I cut a large X where the pit would be prushed out, to prevent the cherry being ripped apart.  For damaged cherries, push the pit out the place where the damage was cut out.  (Damaged cherries sometimes looked better than the &quot;good&quot; ones!))<br/>
  Make simple syrup.  (Combine sugar and water.  Boil. Stir until mixed. Let cool.)<br/>
  Put cherries in jars.  (We did ~14 cherries per jar.  Probably should have done 12, so that they sit below the liquid.)   <br/>
  Pour 1/4 cup of simple syrup into each jar.   <br/> 
  Pour 1/4 cup of liqueur into each jar.  (Jars should have more than 1/4 inch of space left, so that canning works properly.) <br/> 
  Mix lemon juice, almond extract and powdered ginger.  Distribute evenly to jars.  (About 3/4 teaspoon each.) <br/> 
  In each jar put 1/4 inch cinnamon stick, 1/3 inch vanilla bean, 3/4 inch square piece of lemon peel.  (We broke the cinnamon stick lengthwise and put in 1/2 inch pieces.)  <br/> 
  Screw on lids &quot;finger tight&quot;. (If too tight, air can't escape during canning.)<br/> 
  Put cans in pot.  Fill pot with water, just below the lids on the jars. <br/>
  Bring to boil.  Boil for 25 minutes.<br/> 
  Remove and let cool. <br/> 
  <br/> 
  We made 12 jars.  10 good ones and 2 &quot;rejects&quot; without stems.  By volume, the fruit takes up about half of each jar. <br/> 
  <br/> 
  Boiling for 25 minutes may have been longer than necessary.  Also, the alcohol in the bottles might have been enough to preserve the food.  The liqueur is 32% alcohol, which means the jars may be above the 10% that someone on the internet claimed was sufficient.  If you try that, do more research on that 10% and make sure there's enough liquid to completely cover the cherries.  <br/> 
  <br/> 
  <span style="font-style: italic;">This was the recipe that Mom and I tried Jun 17, 2017.  We experimented with the &quot;rejects&quot; by putting in a piece of ginger root with them.</span>
