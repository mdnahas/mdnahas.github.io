  <h1>Austin's Housing Crisis</h1>

  <p> Austin is in a housing crisis.  I'm an economist who has studied the issue, so I built this little website to inform people about the problem. <p>

        

<table style="border:1px solid black;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
  <tr>
    <th>City</th>
    <th>Rent</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Austin</td>
    <td>$973</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dallas</td>
    <td>$733</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Houston</td>
    <td>$674</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>San Antonio</td>
    <td>$600</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p> My measure of the crisis is the cheapest affordable apartment in a city.
