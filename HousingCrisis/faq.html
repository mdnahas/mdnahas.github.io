<h3 id="not_austin">Is my city (not Austin) in a housing crisis?</h3>

<p>Possibly.  About half of all major cities in the USA are in a housing crisis.   The rent of their inexpensive apartments is much higher than in other large growing cities.</p>

<p>I looked at the 50 largest metro areas and the worst ones were (in order): Boston, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego, Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Riverside (California), Virginia Beach, Atlanta, Providence, Washington DC, Portland, Denver, Sacramento, Austin, Seattle and Orlando. </p>

<p>You can determine if your city is in a housing crisis by looking at the price of cheap &quot;acceptable&quot; apartments in your city.  For my study, I defined &quot;acceptable&quot; as being listed on Zillow and defined &quot;cheap&quot; as the 1st percentile in rent.  If that cheap rent is much higher than $750, there is a housing crisis.  $750 is achieveable by other growing cities, like Dallas, Houston, Jacksonville, and Oklahoma City.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="california">Is Austin becoming California?</h3>

<p>Essentially, yes.  I looked at the 50 largest metro areas to search for housing crises.  4 of the worst 5 were in California.  (San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego, and Los Angeles)  California had 2 other cities in the top 50, Riverside and Sacramento, and both were worse than Austin.   California has bad housing crises and Austin seems headed in that direction.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="libertarian">Are you a libertarian/capitalist in favor of deregulating everything?</h3>

<p>No.  The government has an important role to play in defining and regulating markets.  For example, I believe the government has an important role to play in healthcare, both in safety and making sure pre-existing conditions are covered.  And, in housing, there is a role for government in building safety, providing utilities, and negotiating externalities like noise, pollution, and shade.  Despite what you might have heard, most economists are not pure libertarian/capitalist.  We try to identify the right government regulations for the particular situation, in order to make the most people happy. </p>

<p>When a market is appropriate, most economists are in favor of a free market.  There should be no limits on the size/number of the product, no limits on the price of it, and anyone can sell to anyone.  History has shown that these limitations do bad things - some people end up with too much of the product and some end up with too little.  Austin currently has a <em>minimum</em> lot sizes and <em>maximum </em>building heights.  By requiring a minimum lots size, some people buy too much land --- leaving others without.  And by requiring a maximum building height, some people have too short buildings.  These are what is causing our housing shortage.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="other_laws">What other laws should we change?</h3>

<p>We need to make it easy to split a lot in practice.   It is currently legal to split some lots, but developers have stopped doing it because it takes too long and costs too much.  In addition, there other regulations, like curb-width requirements, that effectively prevent lot splitting.</p>

<p>We need to make it possible to build if trees are in the way.  I love the environment and want Austin to have lots of big old trees.  But the laws we have written have made it illegal to cut down some trees and illegal to build near them too.  Those laws need to be more flexible, so that needed housing can be built.  We don&apos;t need to remove these laws, just rewrite them to be more flexible.  And, as a result, we will protect more nature on the edge of Austin by creating a place for people to live inside Austin.</p>

<p>We need, in many places, to take people out of the process.  If builders want to build, they must please the Planning Commission, City Council, and neighbors who live nearby.  An objection by any of these can stop the building from being built.  In order to please them all, builders build smaller buildings or spend time and money building the building.  I&apos;m not saying that people shouldn&apos;t review the plans and, in extreme cases, be able to force changes to the plans.  But we need to let builders build what their customers want.</p>

<p>We need to re-evaluate the fees on new construction.  These drive up the cost of new construction and, therefore, drive up the cost of housing.  Fees do have a place --- the city spends more on infrastructure in a sparse suburb than in a dense city block --- and we should charge more for those.  But, for the most part, city services should be paid by annual property taxes and not construction fees. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="environment">How would this affect Austin&apos;s environment and carbon usage? </h3>

<p>I am not an environmental expert, but I can say that, if we build taller and denser near the center of the city, it will mean less sprawl.  That should improve nature at the edge of the city.  </p>

<p>As for carbon usage, it should drop for transportation, because more people will be near the center of the city and need to travel shorter distances.  Carbon usage should also be lower for heating and cooling, since more people will live in condos or apartment complexes with shared walls.  As for construction, my understanding is that wood is a carbon sink and that making steel and concrete produces greenhouse gases.  Since taller buildings use more concrete and steel, that may produce more greenhouse gases.  We can (and should!) encourage wood and new technology by passing a &quot;carbon tax&quot; on the material used in construction.</p>


<p> </p>

<h3 id="new_affordable_housing">What about building brand-new affordable housing?</h3>

<p>There are many ways people propose building brand-new affordable housing.  Almost all of them are bad because building brand-new affordable housing is not good for the city. </p>

<p>Every city has affordable housing and it is older housing.  Older housing is affordable simplly because it is less desireable and, therefore, cheaper.  Older housing is out-of-style, less energy efficient, and has older technology.  The most affordable is older still and has drafts, leaks, and appliances that break down often.   A healthy growing city will tear down its most affordable housing to creating brand-new buildings that have stylish design, the latest technology and energy efficiency.  That is, luxury housing.   This benefits the poor because the rich move into the new luxury housing, leaving open their previous places, which are slightly older buildings.  Those gets filled by the middle class, which leaves open their previous places.  And those places become the new affordable housing.  And those places are newer, more stylish, more energy-efficient, and have higher tech than the crappy most-affordable building that was torn down to make room for the new luxury housing taken by the rich.  This process, called &quot;filtering&quot;, is a much cheaper way to make affordable housing than building brand-new affordable housing.</p>

<p>During a housing crisis, it might be worthwhile building brand-new crappy housing.  Essentailly, sheds with beds.  Or bunk houses, where small rooms are packed with bunk beds, like in a hostel.  That housing would be cheap and fast to build and be better than sleeping on the sidewalk or in a tent in a park.  But, these solutions are rarely proposed. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="inclusive_zoning">What about density bonuses (a.k.a. &quot;inclusive zoning&quot;)?</h3>

<p>A density bonus or &quot;inclusive zoning&quot; allows an apartment building to be built taller in return for guaranteeing that some apartments are reserved for capital-A &quot;Affordable Housing&quot;.  &quot;Affordable housing&quot; (with a capital-A) means apartments whose rent is lower than the market rate and can only be occupied by families earning less than a certain amount.  E.g., the apartments might rent for less than $1,650 per month and are only availble to families earning less than $66,000 per year.  $66,000 is 60% of the income of the median family of 4 and $1,650 would be 30% of $66,000.</p>

<p>Density bonuses will not solve the housing shortage.  First, the income from rent is lower and, therefore, fewer buildings will be built.  Second, the building design is more complicated, with different apartment styles, which increases the cost and, therefore, fewer buildings will be built.  Third, complying with all the regulations, such as checking the income of its residents, increases costs and, therefore, fewer buildings will be built.  The result is the &quot;Affordable Housing&quot; is very expensive to the city.</p>

<p>Also, it is brand-new affordable housing. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="ADUs">What about accessory dwelling units (a.k.a., ADUs, granny flats, etc.)?</h3>

<p>An accessory dwelling unit (&quot;ADU&quot;) is a small house built behind an existing house.  These buildings go by many names, including &quot;granny flat&quot; and &quot;pool house&quot; (when by a pool).  They sit on the same lot as the existing house and are used to house relatives or are rented.</p>

<p>ADUs do increase the amount of housing in Austin, but not many are being built.  <a href="https://www.austinmonthly.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-accessory-dwelling-units/">Fewer than 300 in 2016</a>.  We should build what people want and, it appears, people do not want ADUs.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="housing_bonds">What about housing bonds?</h3>

<p>A housing bond is a <a href="https://localhousingsolutions.org/housing-policy-library/general-obligation-bonds-for-affordable-housing/">general obligation bond, that is, money borrowed by the city and paid back by city taxes, where the borrowed money is spent on housing</a>.  Austin&apos;s housing bond spending has been on <a href="https://housingworksaustin.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CE-HousingWorks-Final-Version-062322-1.pdf">multiple programs</a>.  One of the largest give money to developers to build capital-A &quot;Affordable Housing&quot;.   &quot;Affordable housing&quot; (with a capital-A) means apartments whose rent is lower than the market rate and can only be occupied by families earning less than a certain amount.  E.g., the apartments might rent for less than $1,375 per month and are only availble to families earning less than $55,000 per year.  ($55,000 is 50% of the income of the median family of 4 in Austin and $1,375 per-month would be 30% of $55,000 per-year.)</p>

<p>We&apos;re in a housing shortage so the important question is &quot;How much more housing gets built?&quot;.   <a href="https://housingworksaustin.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CE-HousingWorks-Final-Version-062322-1.pdf">This report</a> by HousingWorks Austin says that $79 million was spent to create 1712 units, of which 1649 were Affordable.  That&apos;s a cost of $46,144 to the taxpayers for each unit.  But, if the bond money had not been available, what would have happened?  The families in those units would still have had to find somewhere to live.  That is, they still put demand on the market. The land where the building was built would have been available for a for-profit company to build on.  So, housing probably would have been built.  It might have been luxury units, rather than Affordable Housing, so richer people might live there.  Those richer people would leave units open somewhere in Austin, so the &quot;poor&quot; families (they earned up to $88k per year) would probably have found a place elsewhere.  So, it seems Austin spent $79 million and ended up with: (1) about the same number of housing units, but crappier ones (2) less property taxes, (3) 1649 &quot;poor&quot; families in nicer units and paying slightly less rent and (4) the cost of a program to make sure only &quot;poor&quot; families live in those units.  That hardly seems worth $79 million plus the lost taxes.  Austin probably would have been better off giving the $79 million away in a lottery to 1649 even-poorer families.</p>

<p>Also, this is brand-new affordable housing.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="middle_housing">What about &quot;missing middle housing&quot; or &quot;triplexes anywhere&quot;?</h3>

<p>Middle housing is a residential building between a single-family home and a large apartment complex.  A common example is the duplex, which is 2 units in a building slightly larger than a single-family home.  A triplex is a slightly larger dulpex, with 3 units instead of 2.  The term &quot;Missing Middle Housing&quot; refers to the idea that not enough middle housing exists, possibly because zoning laws have discouraged it.  The term &quot;Triplexes Anywhere&quot; refers to a plan to eliminated single-family zoning and allow any lot in the city to build a building with 1, 2 or 3 units in it.  Minneapolis enacted Triplexes Anywhere in 2018.</p>

<p>Allowing middle housing, such as duplexes and triplexes, can increase the amount of housing in Austin.  However, it is worth looking at Minneapolis.  After they enacted Triplexes Anywhere, <a href="https://reason.com/2022/05/11/eliminating-single-family-zoning-isnt-the-reason-minneapolis-is-a-yimby-success-story/">fewer than 100 duplexes and triplexes</a> were built.  <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MINN427BPPRIVSA">Minneapolis saw an increase in building</a>, but <a href="https://www.presspubs.com/citizen/news/council-receives-updates-on-building-activity-county/article_e0db9570-ab8f-11ec-be16-e38e070d6bca.html">most of the new units were in apartments (a.k.a. &quot;multi-family&quot;)</a>.  So, while &quot;Triplexes Anywhere&quot; grabbed the headlines, the success in Minneapolis was due to building more apartments. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="public_housing">What about public housing?</h3>

<p>Public housing is when the government owns housing and rents it.   The government may rent it below market rates.  The government may make or loss money renting the building, with any profit or loss going to/from the taxpayers. </p>

<p>Public housing will not solve the housing shortage, unless the government builds more housing than private companies.  Remember, right now, private companies want to build more housing --- taller buildings and more houses on split lots --- except the government is preventing that.  It seems simpler to just get rid of the restrictions on private companies building more housing.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="rent_control">What about rent control or rent stabilization?</h3>

<p>Rent control is when the government stops landlords from increasing the rent.  Rent stabilization is when the government sets the rent increases allowed by landlords.</p>

<p>This will not solve the housing shortage.  It does not create new housing.  In fact, it decreases the incentives on for-profit companies to build new housing.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="land_trusts">What about land trusts?</h3>

<p>A land trust is when the government or a non-profit buys land and allows a resident to own the house on the land.  The resident usually plays a small annual fee to rent the land.   This allows poorer residents to own a house, because the mortgage covers only the house and not the expensive land.  The residents save money because the fee is cheaper than the mortgage payment for the land would have been. </p>

<p>Land trusts will not solve the housing shortage.  In general, they do not create new houses.  Moreover, land trusts are costly: buying the land is expensive and the city loses the property tax revenue from it. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="housing_vouchers">What about housing vouchers?</h3>

<p>Housing vouchers are government-given vouchers that help pay for rent.  The most common program is Section 8, which hands out rent vouchers to low-income residents.  The holder of a voucher can rent (almost) any lower-than-average cost apartment.  The voucher guarantees that the holder never pays more than 30% of their income for housing, no matter what the rent.  E.g., if the rent is $1,000 and the holder only made $2,000 that month, the holder would pay $600 (30% of $2000) and the voucher will be good for the other $400 of the rent. </p>

<p>Vouchers make more money available to buy housing.  This can incentivize for-profit companies to build more housing to rent to voucher holders.  But this only works if more housing can be built.  If it cannot, vouchers will drive up the cost of housing.  Low-income residents who do not have vouchers will pay more or go homeless.</p>

<p>So, vouchers are a good way to help the poor afford housing.  (Much better than rent control, rent stabilization, land trusts, density bonuses, or housing bonds.)  But they will not solve the housing shortage. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="displacement">Won&apos;t this increase displacement?</h3>

<p>Displacement is when a community is forced out of a part of a city.  By &quot;forced&quot;, I means families that normally would have stayed left.  Families leave due to things like rent increases,  evictions, foreclosures, abuse from landlords, etc..  Displacement (in the economic literature) does not refer to gradual change, which happens when home owners die or voluntarily move away and the new residents moving in are not of the same community.  In Austin, displacement usually refers to Black and Latino communities being forced out. </p>

<p>Displacement <em>and </em>gradual change are serious problems.  A community is not just its residents, but its cultural institutions and gathering places: churchs, halls, music venues, restaurants, bars, etc..  The movement of a community&apos;s members far from these will decay the community.  The community will lose its ability to organize to accomplish projects (such as using political power) and lose its ability to help its members in need.</p>

<p>From what I&apos;ve heard, most of the displacement and gradual change in Austin is caused by higher rent and home prices.  One person has told me that home loans are difficult for Black residents to get.  I&apos;m not of the Black or Latino community, so there may be other things happening that I haven&apos;t heard of.  It shouldn&apos;t be a surprise to anyone that, as land prices have increased in Austin, it is harder for low-wealth communities to buy homes in Austin.  The best solution is to lower rents and home prices.  So, solving the housing shortage is a major part of the solution to displacement and gradual change.  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/oplls6utgf7z6ih/Pennington_JMP.pdf?dl=0">Recent research has show that building more housing decreases displacement</a>. </p>

<p>To be clear, increasing the amount of housing will allow the communities to remain in their parts of the city, but the increased housing may also allow other communities to move in too.  But that&apos;s fine (unless you&apos;re against integration).  The original community will still have access to its cultural institutions and gathering places. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="gentrification">Won&apos;t this increase gentrification?</h3>

<p>Gentrification is when the average income increases, in a part of the city.  That is, a neighborhood gets richer residents.  This is usually accompanied by businesses that serve richer customers: espresso shops, craft breweries, dog groomers, etc..  It may mean fewer businesses to serve the neighborhood&apos;s poorer residents.  Gentrificiation is often accompanied by increased rent and <a href="https://youtu.be/cEsC5hNfPU4?t=349">may cause displacement</a>.   </p>

<p>Removing minimum lot sizes and maximum building heights will cause gentrification in some of Austin, but <em>not</em> creating more housing will cause gentrificiation in <em>all</em> of Austin.  If we remove minimum lot sizes and maximum building heights, it is likely that tall luxury apartment buildings will appear on major roads within 2 miles of downtown.  Those neighborhoods might get richer residents and new businesses to serve them.  But the larger supply of housing will help push down the price of housing outside those neighborhoods.   If we do not build more housing, the price of housing will go up everywhere.  Every community in Austin will see higher rents and may get displacement.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="neighborhood_character">Won&apos;t this change the neighborhood character?</h3>

<p>I hear this question often.  And often, in the same conversation, I hear how it is a shame that they&apos;re closing the school nearby.  There aren&apos;t many families in the neighbhorhood, now a days.  The asker, with their spouse within arm reach, tells me how they&apos;re getting on in years and soon they&apos;ll have to sell their house and, when they do, they hope it is to a young family.  Like they were when they moved into the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Austin&apos;s neighborhood character has changed.  Slowly over time.   Young families don&apos;t move into Hyde Park or Zilker.  The houses there are expensive.  Parents would rather live some place cheaper and spend money on their kids, not their mortgage.  I heard a UT professor bought in Leander, because it was the closest place she could afford. </p>

<p>So, yes, removing the minimum lot size and maximum building height will change the neighborhood character.  Yes, it may mean new houses will be built on smaller lots, but it will also mean families can afford to live there.   If you want to see children playing and UT professors cycling to work, we need to change some neighborhoods&apos; character back to what they were.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="developers">Won&apos;t this benefit evil greedy developers?</h3>

<p>Developers can profit most by <em>fixing</em> the housing shortage.  In any shortage, the business that can provide what you need will make money.  We&apos;re in a housing shortage and the developers can provide housing.  I&apos;m fine with them making money.</p>

<p>Developers are not profiting from the shortage.  Landlords are profitting from higher rents and land sellers are profitting from higher land prices.  I think they are evil. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="traffic">Won&apos;t streets become more congested?</h3>

<p>Allowing more housing to be built near downtown will probably cause a more car traffic in those neighborhoods.  Keep in mind that people choose where to live based on their travel patterns and developers will take that into consideration when building. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="parking">Won&apos;t we run out of street parking?</h3>

<p>There will be more demand for street parking in many neighborhoods.  And the city should pass laws to deal with it.  Many residents bought houses and bought cars based on the expectation of free easy street parking near their house.  Those residents don&apos;t own that street parking --- the city does --- but we should respect that they made big financial decisions based on it. </p>

<p>We can put in parking meters, to prevent the street parking from becoming full.  And we can create parking passes for residents who bought cars based on the expectation of free parking.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="infrastructure">Won&apos;t we run out of sewers, and other infrastructure?</h3>

<p>I&apos;m not an expert on this.  I&apos;m sure the city can limit the number of units in some areas based on infrastructure.  I&apos;m also sure the city can expand the infrastructure if there is enough demand for housing in an area.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="fixed_income">Won&apos;t this raise taxes on people with a fixed income?</h3>

<p>I am not an expert on taxes, but my understanding is that people over 65 get a &quot;senior freeze&quot; on increases to their homestead for school property taxes.  The state puts other limits on increases too.  So, where taxes will increase, the effect may be limited for many on a fixed income.  Unfortunately, state law restricts what the city can do to limit the effects further.</p>

<p>Yes, changing the law may hurt some of Austin&apos;s residents.  But not changing the law will also hurt some residents.  And I think those hurt by not changing the law are more numerous and on tighter budgets.  So I think we should change the law. </p>

<p>To see who might be affected by higher taxes, see the answer for  &quot;How will this affect me financially&quot;.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="nimby">Why don&apos;t we &quot;upzone&quot; only some places, and not near my house?</h3>

<p>The biggest (economic) reason to allow housing to be built everywhere is that no one knows where people want housing.   Certainly, the city&apos;s experts make educated guesses and try to plan for infrastructure appropriately, but they don&apos;t know for sure.  Also, we don&apos;t know how new technology and tastes will shape the city.  By allowing small lots and tall buildings everywhere, we allow flexibility for the city to fulfill people&apos;s needs.   </p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="tech_bros">Isn&apos;t this all the fault of the &quot;tech bros&quot;?</h3>

<p>By &quot;fault&quot;, this question makes it sound like we can solve the problem by kicking out the &quot;tech bros&quot; or keeping more from moving here.  And that isn&apos;t a solution.  America is a free country and people can live where they want.  Austin cannot build a border wall to keep out &quot;tech bros&quot;.</p>

<p>Even if we could, we shouldn&apos;t.  Austin is lucky to have a growing industry with high-salary employees.  I grew up in Allentown, PA.  The steel companies and truck manufacturers had left.  The city was shrinking.  Jobs were scarce.  It was dirty.  There was property crime.  I&apos;m glad my family left and moved to Austin.  We are blessed to live in a city that thrives due to its growing industry.  Many cities would gladly take our &quot;tech bros&quot; if they could.</p>

<p>Yes, a growing industry causes growth and growing pains.  We can fix those by fixing our zoning.</p>
