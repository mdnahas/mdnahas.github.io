  <h1>Austin's Housing Crisis References</h1>

<p>These are some of the references I used as an economist to learn about the housing crisis.  Some are very accessible.  Some are academic references.  These are best; I have not tried to include everything I've read.</p>

<li><a href="https://austin-housing-ut-austin.opendata.arcgis.com/">2021 Austin Housing Analysis</a> gathered a lot of data and has pretty results.  It shows that, currently, low-income households live in large apartment buildings and high-income households live in houses.  That's a change from the 1990's where more low-income households lived in houses and duplexes.  Some of those homes were manufactured homes (mobile homes).  The authors are not economists but attempted to study &quot;filtering&quot; anyway.  They saw its effect lowering the relative price of homes up to 50 years old.  But they went on make the strange claim that even older units "bounce back" in price due to "gentrification".  While some old homes become classics, most do not and the classics have expensive upkeep and low prices.  What happened was that the authors didn't correct for the distance to downtown and older homes are mostly close to downtown.  Thus, the land under those homes is valuable, even if the buildings are old.  This analysis and a lot of their resulting policy recommendations are incorrect.</li>
